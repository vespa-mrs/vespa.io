# PyWavelets for OS X
Vespa-Analysis uses [PyWavelets](http://www.pybytes.com/pywavelets/). 
PyWavelets' author doesn't make pre-built binaries available for OS X, so we 
make a set available here. 

## PyWavelets 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 for 64-bit Python
We offer a wheel file [raw-attachment:PyWavelets-0.3.0-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_5_x86_64.whl for PyWavelets 0.3.0 for 64-bit Python 2.7 on OS X] and a separate wheel file for 
[raw-attachment:PyWavelets-0.4.0-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_5_x86_64.whl PyWavelets 0.4.0 for 64-bit Python 2.7 on OS X].

To install, download the file and then enter this command, substituting the name of the fie you downloaded -- 
```
pip install /path/to/PyWavelets-xxx.whl
```

## PyWavelets 0.2.0 for 32-bit Python
You can [raw-attachment:PyWavelets-OSX.tar.gz download our PyWavelets for OS X] 
([attachment:PyWavelets-OSX.tar.gz.md5.txt MD5],
