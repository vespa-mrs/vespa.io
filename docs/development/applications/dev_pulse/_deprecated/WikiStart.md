# Welcome to Vespa-Pulse
Pulse is a GUI-based visualization program that provides a user-friendly front end for the generation of Pulses using a variety of algorithms, including Shinnar-LeRoux (SLR), hyperbolic secant (adiabatic), Optimal Control, Gaussian, and Randomized. Pulse also incorporates many other RF pulse design calculations and manipulations. Pulse is written in [the Python programming language](http://www.python.org). It is both an adaptation and in some cases an extension of Dr. Gerald (Jerry) Matson's "MATPULSE" program (which is written in [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com)).

Pulse is part of the [project:wiki free, open-source Vespa package].

In Pulse, users can:
  1. Create and visualize an RF pulse in a linear, step-by-step process. 
  1. Store design steps, parameters, and results in a database. 
  1. Compare results from various pulse projects.
  1. Output results in XML, text, or other graphical formats.

One of the main design criteria of Vespa-Pulse is to maintain a history of the provenance used to create a pulse. 

Pulse is free to use and is open source. We encourage usage by and contributions from other researchers.
