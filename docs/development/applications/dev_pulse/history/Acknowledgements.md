# Acknowledgements for the Pulse Application
This is a short, and likely incomplete, list of contributions and inspirations that helped in the development of a solid Pulse application. Along the way, we've given a nod towards a bit of history.

 * First and foremost a huge thank you to the original developers for the Vespa package, Philip Semanchuk, David Todd, Karl Young (and I guess me, Brian Soher) for the hard work and dedication to see this thing fly. In particular, kudos to David for spearheading the conversion of the the MatPulse GUI/algorithms and Karl for his help in algorithm adaptation and extension. Without the never-ending work these guys did, this application would be far less than it is today.

 * Also a solid nod towards the National Institutes of Health for funding this through grant number 1R01EB008387-01A1.


Now for a little history and thank-yous! The original program that inspired this work was: 

 * *MatPulse* - a solo masterpiece by Jerry Matson as part of his long and distinguished career at UC San Francisco. This platform is a tool for producing optimized RF pulses for use in a variety of magnetic resonance investigations. Much of the work on this program has been 'cumulative' across the years. As part of its inclusion in the Vespa package, Dr. Matson has extensively consulted with us on which parts are most important, and in what order we should incorporate them.

 * The original version of the Pulse application was called 'RFPulse', but we subsequently did a complete redesign which resulted in the Pulse application in order to be more in line with application architectures created/modified in the Simulation and Analysis application.  Most importantly, the Pulse application provides users with an internal RF pulse algorithm development/testing tool. So users no longer have to add on to the application's Python code to add new algorithms to Pulse.
