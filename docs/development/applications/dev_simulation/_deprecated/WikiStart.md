# Welcome to Vespa - Simulation
Vespa-Simulation is a graphical control and visualization program written in the Python programming language that provides a user friendly front end to the [gamma:wiki GAMMA/PyGAMMA NMR simulation library]. 
Simulation is part of [project:wiki the free, open source Vespa suite].
Simulation allows users to: 
  1. Create and run a simulated Experiment (consisting of one or more spectral simulations) from lists of metabolites and pulse sequences. 
  1. Store simulated Experiment results in a database. 
  1. Display the results in a flexible plotting/graphing tool.
  1. Output results in xml, text or graphical formats to share with other users
  1. Design/test PyGAMMA pulse sequences for use in Simulation Experiments.

There are a number of predefined pulse sequences in the Vespa-Simulation environment. The database also contains extensive prior information (chemical shift and J-coupling) for many MR visible compounds.
