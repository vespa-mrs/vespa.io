# Acknowledgements for the Simulation Application
This is a short, and likely incomplete, list of contributions and inspirations that helped in the development of a solid Simulation application. Along the way, we've given a nod towards a bit of history.

 * First and foremost a huge thank you to the original developers for the Vespa package, Philip Semanchuk, David Todd, Karl Young (and I guess me, Brian Soher) for the hard work and dedication to see this thing fly. 

 * Also a solid nod towards the National Institutes of Health for funding this through grant number 1R01EB008387-01A1.

 * The metabolite prior information that populates the startup database and makes all the PyGamma simulations possible was derived from the stellar publication by Varanavasi Govindaraju (Govind!), Karl Young and Andrew Maudsley, in NMR in Biomedicine, Vol.13, pages 129-153. While there have been a few other contributions towards these values, this work is by far the keystone towards accurate and robust spectral simulation around.

Now for a little history and thank-yous! The original program that inspired this work was: 

 * *GAVA* - Brian Soher, Karl Young, Aaron Berstein and Zakaria Aygula with funding and inspiration from Andrew Maudsley at UC San Francico. This program was of course motivated by and made possible by the graduate work of Scott Smith who developed the GAMMA C++ spectral simulation library. Dr. Andrew Maudsley had both the inspiration (and funding) to want to make this resource available more easily to others in the clinical magnetic resonance world. Young and Berstein created the initial infrastructure for simulation under Linux. Soher translated this to Windows and wrapped it in an IDL GUI and GAVA was 'born'. Soher, Young and Aygula all worked on maintaining GAVA on Windows and Linux, and towards extending the ability of simulations to account for 'real world' condition while at University of Miami. Soher aquired funding for maintaining and extending GAVA into the Vespa-Simulation application in 2008.
