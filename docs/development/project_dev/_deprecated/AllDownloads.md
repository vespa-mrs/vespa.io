This page contains all versions of Vespa up to and including 0.8.6, from the oldest to the most recent. That version was the last to be distributed from this site. 

Versions of Vespa > 0.8.6 (including the current version) are on [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Vespa-Suite).

Vespa 0.2.2 was a broken version that was only current for 3 hours before it was replaced by 0.2.3. We removed it from this page since there's no point in downloading it.
