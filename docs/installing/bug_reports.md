# How to Report Bugs

## Vespa User Forum  

If you have questions, comments or a solution about some topic in Vespa, please post them on [the Vespa Forum on MRS Hub](<https://forum.mrshub.org/c/mrs-software/vespa/11>). 

*Note. Vepsa has in the past used other mailing list providers to stay in contact with our community. But going forward we will be using the Vespa Sub-Topic under the MRSHub Forum.*  

## Bug Reports

Pure and simple Bug Reports should be sent to us directly at the main Vespa contact email - vespa.bugs@gmail.com. Alternatively, they can be posted on [the Vespa Forum on MRS Hub](<https://forum.mrshub.org/c/mrs-software/vespa/11>), too. Both methods send an email to the Vespa Team. 

*Please remember to paste the Exception report provided by the application if the bug caused a crash.*
