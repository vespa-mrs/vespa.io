# New Install

These are the recommended steps for a new installation:

Vespa is a Python package. It requires that a Python environment be
installed with certain required additional modules (all easily obtained)
and then Vespa can be automatically installed from the PyPI web site.
For historical reasons, the package on PyPI is called Vespa-Suite. As of
version 1.0.0, Vespa only runs under Python 3.

Full instructions for installation can be accessed online at:

Vespa is an actively developed project that has frequent releases. Once
you have it installed, it is easy to upgrade as described here:
