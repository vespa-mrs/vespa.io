# PyGAMMA/GAMMA

***GAMMA*** is a C++ library for the simulation of magnetic resonance (NMR, MRS) experiments. It provides a simple and intuitive means to construct simulation programs to suit researchers' individual needs. GAMMA is an acronym for a *G*eneral *A*pproach to *M*agnetic resonance *M*athematical *A*nalysis.

***PyGamma*** is a Python wrapper around GAMMA that makes almost all of GAMMA's API available via [Python](http://www.python.org/). PyGamma users can skip the C++ compile and link steps and can even run GAMMA commands interactively line-by-line.

Both GAMMA and PyGAMMA work on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

## Where to Access PyGAMA/GAMMA

Vespa version 1.0.0 included a move to Python 3 and to storing the package on Github. As part of this move, PyGAMMA/GAMMA became its own repository with its own Github Pages documentation site.  They can be accessed at: 

- [Code repository](https://github.com/pygamma-mrs/gamma) 

- [Documentation](https://pygamma-mrs.github.io/gamma.io) 

The documentation site contains all the Installation, Development and Technical information that used to be stored here.
