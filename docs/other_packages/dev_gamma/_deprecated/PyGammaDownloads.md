# PyGamma Downloads
As of version 4.3.3, PyGamma is distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI). You don't need to download it explicitly anymore; it happens automatically as part of the installation step.

You can install PyGamma by following the [PyGamma#InstallingPyGamma PyGamma installation instructions].

Older versions are on the PyGammaAllDownloads page.
