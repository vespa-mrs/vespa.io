# Welcome to the GAMMA/PyGamma Library
*GAMMA* is a C++ library for the simulation of magnetic resonance (NMR, MRS) experiments. It provides a simple and intuitive means to construct simulation programs to suit researchers' individual needs. GAMMA is an acronym for a *G*eneral *A*pproach to *M*agnetic resonance *M*athematical *A*nalysis.

*PyGamma* is a Python wrapper around GAMMA that makes almost all of GAMMA's API available via [Python](http://www.python.org/). PyGamma users can skip the C++ compile and link steps and can even run GAMMA commands interactively line-by-line.

Both GAMMA and PyGamma work on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

For more information, refer to our [GammaDetailedDescription detailed description of GAMMA] and our [PyGamma main PyGamma page].

## How To Get GAMMA and PyGamma
We have [GammaBuildingLibrary instructions on how to download and build GAMMA].

You can 
[install PyGamma with Python's pip](https://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/wiki/PyGamma#InstallingPyGamma).

## Documentation
The original documentation written by Scott Smith in the [browser:/trunk/doc/pdf gamma/doc/pdf] directory of the GAMMA source code distribution.

The PDFs include a user manual, and one document each for most GAMMA modules. These documents are somewhat dated. Nevertheless, they serve as a useful reference to what the library can do, and how to do it.

We also supply C++ examples in in the [browser:trunk/src/Tests gamma/src/Tests] folder, and Python examples in [browser:trunk/src/pyTests gamma/src/pyTests].

For the very ambitious, we have [archived the HTML from the old GAMMA Web site](http://scion.duhs.duke.edu/guest_svn/gamma_docs/trunk/).


## Developer (Technical) Documentation
If you're interested in more technical details about GAMMA/PyGamma 
including notes from the developers themselves, or suggestions on how to contribute to GAMMA/PyGamma, we have a whole section
dedicated to [TechnicalDocumentation developer documentation].


## Proper Citation in Papers and Presentations
Proper reference should be given, using the citation below, when GAMMA simulations are used in papers and/or presentations.

## Thanks
Thanks to the *NIH* (*grant number 1R01EB008387-01A1*) which funded the recent work on GAMMA, PyGamma and this website via the [project:wiki:WikiStart Vespa project].

Thanks also to those who have [GammaContributors contributed their time and skills] to GAMMA/PyGamma.
