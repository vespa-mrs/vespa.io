# Code Cleanup
If you have used GAMMA in the past and cannot find your favorite directory, it is possible that it was removed during our code cleanup.


The "primal" directory was renamed "platforms".

Specific Build Directories that were deleted from the old primal directory are:
  * Borland
  * CygMin
  * Irix
  * MinGW
  * MSVC++

The *msvc* directory was moved into the directory formerly known as _primal_ and now known as _platforms_.
