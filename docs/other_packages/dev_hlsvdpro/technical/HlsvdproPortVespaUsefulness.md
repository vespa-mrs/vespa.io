# Is This Useful to Vespa?
Short answer: almost.

Long answer: the code shows great promise. There are three things that undermine its usefulness to Vespa. If any two of these problems could be solved, we could probably tolerate the third enough to consider using this code in Vespa.

Here's the list of problems that need to be solved. Each linked page contains some suggested solutions.

1. The lack of a good way to call [HlsvdproPortDbdsqr dbdsqr()]
1. The occasional [HlsvdproPortBugs  bad output] when processing `laser_2010102901.xml`
1. [HlsvdproPortPerformance Performance]
